#Oasis Web (pet project)

 

##What is OasisWeb?

 

The word **Oasis** means a fertile spot in a desert, where water is found.

In relation to this project the name refers to a solution that is supposed to help people find exactly what they are looking for with little effort on their own. They should express intent and the 'system' should give them what they want.

Having being in a situation where I was looking for an apartment, and having known a couple of friends who were all experiencing the same challenges when it comes to finding a place to stay.

 

Rather than the conventional way of a homeseeker browsing catalogs and listings of apartments on the internet and in newspapers, and submitting numerous applications to many property owners/agents etc, I decided to make it easier for homeseekers to find places.

The Oasis solution will allow the following:

1. A home seeker completes a simple application form to find a place.

2. The Oasis engine will perform automated shortlisting for new applications in sepecific areas/regisons/etc and send notifications to the correct agents/property owners.

3. Agents/Property owners can view applications for their domain/region/city/territory and with the information supplied on applications perform background checks/criminal checks/credit checks/etc.

4. Agents send a "proposal" to a home seeker with potential places.

 

The difference between traditional home seeking and Oasis is that in Oasis the homeseeker doesn't look for places. The places look for the homeseeker based on their profile.

 

##Solution approach:

 

**This a pet project.** The objective is to cement my personal tech-stack knowledge by developing this solution.

OasisWeb will be thus built in different tech stacks in different phases.

For phase 1, it will be build using JEE (Servlets/EJB/JPA/ etc).

Phase 2 Oasis will be rewritten from the ground up using Spring 4.x MVC

Phase 3 Oasis will be built using SpringBoot.

 

In phase 1 the front end will be simple HTML/CSS/JQuery. By phase 3 the front end should be AngularJS.
